This project explores [brief description of your project]. The following report outlines the steps, analysis, and visualizations conducted during the project.

### Project Report:
- Introduction:
- 
For our project we wanted to answer questions about DUI deaths and drinking in general nationally. We wanted to compare national drinking to DUI deaths to see if consumption increases deaths, compare weather to both drinking and deaths, along with other variables. 
To accomplish these goals, we used several datasets, one on average monthly temperature by US state, one on alcohol consumption per state by liter of ethanol, and one on impaired driving death rates for each state between 2012 and 2014. We tackled this by both independently creating our own visualizations to try to come up with as many correlations and conclusions as possible. The main questions we had where:

* Does a state consuming more alcohol result in larger DUI deaths?
* Does the temperature affect how much a state drinks?
* Does the type of alcohol a state consumes correlate to DUI deaths?
* Does the temperature of a state affect DUI deaths?
